# Ohnologs docs

This is the documentation for the [ohnologs database](https://ohnologs.com). You can read it online [here](https://ohnologs.com/docs).

## About the database

There is a general lack of easily accessible, high-quality ohnolog databases - while several datasets exist, they are either badly documented, or lack (in our opinion) crucial data filtering and visualisation features. We aim to offer a service that attempts to address all the shortcomings of current alternatives:

- **Multiple sources of evidence** (macro-synteny, micro-synteny, and gene trees) are used to classify genes are ohnologs
- We **distinguish between 1R and 2R** duplicate pairs
- We offer **multiple ways to filter and select** genes from our dataset
- Users can **browse our data** before downloading using our online interface
- We offer multiple ways to **visualise and analyse genes** in our dataset
- Our process is **well documented, freely available, and reproducable**

## Features

The features available on our website are summarised below. Each feature is documented more thoroughly on its dedicated docs page.

### Download our data

If you want to download our entire dataset, [click here](https://data.ohnologs.com/ohnologs.zip). Alternatively, you can choose what data to download by browsing to one of the following pages:

- Species page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/species) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/species)
- Gene page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/genes) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/gene)

### Search our data

If you already have some genes of interest and want to search our database with those in mind, you can do so by browsing to one of the following pages:

- Selection page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/select) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/select)
- BLAST page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/blast) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/blast)

### Visualise our data

If you want to visualise the data that you have selected, be that single genes or entire genomes, you can generate figures in real time on the following pages:

- Circos page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/circos) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/circos)
- Dotplot page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/dotplot) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/dotplot)
- Phylogeny page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/tree) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/tree)
- Microsynteny page - [docs](https://ohnologs.com/docs/guides/synteny) | [website](https://ohnologs.com/synteny)

## Use cases

The tools provided on our website can be useful for data-exploration and simple analyses. Below is a (far from exhaustive) list of problems that our website can solve:

### I have a favourite gene

You can visit the [BLAST](https://ohnologs.com/blast) page to find homologs of your favourite gene that are present in our database. The resulting genes can either be downloaded or selected. Any genes that are currently in your selection will be highlighted across all plots on our website.

### I'm interested in a specific gene family

You can visit the [selection](https://ohnologs.com/select) page and provide a FASTA or TSV file to find any matching genes that are present in our database. The results can either be downloaded or selected. Any genes that are currently in your selection will be highlighted across all plots on our website.

### I like pretty graphs

You're in luck! You can visit any of the [circos](https://ohnologs.com/circos), [dotplot](https://ohnologs.com/dotplot), [tree](https://ohnologs.com/tree), or [synteny](https://ohnologs.com/synteny) pages and (hopefully) enjoy what you see ;). If you're still not satisfied, let us know what we can do to satiate your immeasurable hunger for pretty graphs.

### I'm confused

You're in the right place! We provide comprehensive [documentation](https://ohnologs.com/docs) for each feature available on our website. If you don't feel like reading, visit a [random page](...) and go exploring. That'll work too... probably.
