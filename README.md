# Ohnologs docs

This is the documentation for the [ohnologs database](https://aoifolution.gen.tcd.ie/ohnologs). You can read it online [here](https://aoifolution.gen.tcd.ie/ohnologs/docs).

## About the database

There is a general lack of easily accessible, high-quality ohnolog databases - while several datasets exist, they are either badly documented, or lack (in our opinion) crucial data filtering and visualisation features. We aim to offer a service that attempts to address all the shortcomings of current alternatives:

- **Multiple sources of evidence** (macro-synteny, micro-synteny, and gene trees) are used to classify genes are ohnologs
- We **distinguish between 1R and 2R** duplicate pairs
- We offer **multiple ways to filter and select** genes from our dataset
- Users can **browse our data** before downloading using our online interface
- We offer multiple ways to **visualise and analyse genes** in our dataset
- Our process is **well documented, freely available, and reproducable**
