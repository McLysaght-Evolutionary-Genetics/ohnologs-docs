A Guide to Navigating the Website

BLAST
>By clicking into the box under 'gene sequence' you can type in and search for a specific gene sequence.


Gene
>To find specific genes and proteins start by selecting your species of choice then move on to scaffold, segmentation, etc.
>It is not necessary to select options in all the boxes but it refines what you are searching for.


Genome
>Selecting a genome/genomes in the table allows you to download the data available.
>Clicking 'cancel' removes the genes you have selected for the table.
>Clicking the magnifying glass icon (towards the right hand side of the page) allows you to search for a specific genome.

Select
>Clicking the 'drag and drop' allows you to upload your own files to the site.
>You can search for specific genes or proteins by clicking into the box under 'selection.'

Circos
>Using the 'Query Species' box allows you to select a species that will be used for creating a circos plot.
>Once a species has been selected, you are able to select specific genes you wish to see on the circos plot.
>The green line(s) is a gene that you have selected for the plot.
>Clicking 'cancel' removes the options you have selected from the table.
>CLicking 'download' downloads all the data from the table. If you wish to only download certain data, select the gene(s) of choice and then click 'download.'

Dotplot
>To see a dotplot you must select a species in both the 'Query species' box and 'Subject species' box. Note that you can select the same species in both boxes.
>If a dotplot was generated using two different species, the table below will show data which can be downloaded.
>Clicking 'cancel' removes the genes you have selected for the table.


Synteny
>The diagram can be moved around by holding down and moving the image with a mouse.
>The image can be enlarged and shrunk by first clicking the image then scrolling up or down on a mouse.


Tree
>If you hover over any particular branch on the tree you can click it which highlights it in red. Clicking that same branch again removes the highlighting.
>You can highlight multiple parts of the tree in blue, dotted lines by clicking and dragging the screen (on a part other than a branch). This box can then be dragged around the screen which will highlight other parts of the tree. Right clicking then left clicking removes the blue highlighting.
