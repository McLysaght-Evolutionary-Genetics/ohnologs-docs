<u><h4>Introduction To the Website</h4></u>
<p>Our website was created in response to a general lack of accessible ohnolog datasets as well as visual representations of ohnologs. Furthermore, obtaining certain rights from the researchers themselves may be necessary to access this data. A key feature of the website is that users are able to freely download all the data available.</p>

<p>On the website you are able to select certain genes and genomes using the tables which can be located towards the bottom of most sections. This allows you to create dotplots that compare the genomes of two distinct species, circos plots of one species at a time, and explore gene trees, as well as view ohnolog data sets and download them. You can also view external databases if you wish to access to more data than what is provided on the website.</p>

<p>Below are some key definitons that are useful to know when using the website,</p>
<ul>
<li>Whole Genome Duplication (WGD): An event in which an extra copy, or copies in some cases, of the genome of an organism is made</li>
<li>Ohnologs: Genes that arise from WGD events</li>
<li>Synteny: Two or more genes being on the same chromosome in a particular species</li>
<li>Microsynteny: A type of synteny in which only a small number of genes are conserved</li>
<li>Circos Plot: A visual representation of genomic data</li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Tables</h4></p></u>
<p>Tables can be found at the bottom of most sections of the website. Not all tables have the exact same headings, The table below shows all the headings that may be seen on the website.<p>


| Genome | Protein |Species | State | Source | Version | Scaffolds | Sections | Genes |


<p>
All the data from the website is public and you can freely download all the data or just select specific genes. In order in to do this you will need to locate table that contains the data you are interested in. To select all the data you need to select the first box on your table, it is located to the left hand side of the first table heading, either gene or genome depending on what section of the website you are on. Once selected, the top of the table will have a blue rectangle and button to download data will be located on the right hand side of the rectangle.

To only download specific genes or genomes, you will need to locate table that contains the data you are interested in. Now, you will need to select the boxes next to the gene or genome of choice. Note that there may be many pages of data in some tables so it may be useful to you to manually search for the gene or genome using the search bar in those cases. However, not all tables allow you to do this and you may need to select the boxes at the top of the website section you are on to refine your search. Once selected, the top of the table will have a blue rectangle and button to download data will be located on the right hand side of the rectangle.

<h4><p><u>Global Selection</h4></p></u>
One of the tools available on the website is Global Selection. This means that when a gene is selected anywhere on our website, either through a table, or graphically, it will continue to be added to your selection. This selection persists across pages and this may affect any plots, searches or data you wish to download.If you wish to avoid this,it is important to ensure that no genes are still selected in the table beforehand. You can do this by selecting then unselecting the box next to the first heading of a table, if you are on the Species section or by unselecting the options you have picked in the boxes at the top of the section you are on. Note that Global Selection is specific for genes selected, it does not persist with species selected.

<h4><p><u>Databases, Internal Links and External Links</u></p></h4>

In the tables on our website there is a 'source' section, this leads to external links. These external links lead to digital databases for you to explore as the website only has a small selection of the genes and genomes available.You can use the data on the external databases to further learn or research what you are interested in. The external databases are Ensembl, RefSeq and other.

In the the table on the Gene section, there is a 'protein' heading. There you will be able to see two blue  icons, these are internal links that will take you to a place within our website. These lead you to parts of the website once you have selcted genes. The icon to the left will lead you to the Tree section and the icon to the right will lead you to the Synteny section.
