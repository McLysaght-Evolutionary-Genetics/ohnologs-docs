<h5>This is a general guide for the website, there are detailed guides for specific sections of the website on this website as well</h5>

</head>

<ul>
<li>This website allows users to view ohnolog datasets, create visualisations and view gene trees</li>
<li>In the tables clicking the links in 'source' will lead you to ensemble, an online database for genes</li>
<li>All the data available in the tables on the website are downloadable, you can download everything or select and download data for specific genes</li>
<li>All the data from the website is public</li>
</ul>

:::note
When genes have been previously selected, even on another tab, they are still selected and this may affect any plots, searches or data you wish to download. To eliminate this problem it is important to make sure that no genes are still selected in the table beforehand.
