<u><h4>Introduction To our Website</h4></u>
<p>Our website was created in response to a general lack of accessible ohnolog datasets as well as visual representations of ohnologs. Furthermore, obtaining certain rights from the researchers themselves may be necessary to access the data on those sites. A key feature of the website is that users are able to freely download all of the data available.</p>

<p>On the website you are able to select certain genes and genomes using the tables which can be located towards the bottom of most sections. This allows you to create dotplots that compare the genomes of two distinct species, circos plots of one species at a time, and explore gene trees, as well as view ohnolog data sets and download them. You can also view external databases if you wish to access to more data than what is provided on our website.</p>

<p>Below are some key definitons that are useful to know when using the website,</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Whole Genome Duplication (WGD):</b>  An event in which an extra copy, or copies in some cases, of the genome of an organism is made</li>
<li><b>Ohnologs:</b>      Genes that arise from WGD events</li>
<li><b>Synteny:</b>       Two or more genes being on the same chromosome in a particular species</li>
<li><b>Microsynteny:</b>  A type of synteny in which only a small number of genes are conserved</li>
<li><b>Circos Plot:</b>   A visual representation of genomic data</li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Tables</h4></p></u>
<p>The majority of the website's sections end with tables. Not all tables have exactly the same headers; the following table lists all possible headings on the website.<p>


| Genome | Protein |Species | State | Source | Version | Scaffolds | Genes |Segments|

<p>The points below explain what each header refers to, </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Genome:</b>     Name of the genome</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b>    Name of the protein</li>
<li><b>Species:</b>    Name of the species</li>
<li><b>State:</b>      The genome will either be present, a modern genome, or other, an ancient genome</li>
<li><b>Source:</b>     Where the data came from</li>
<li><b>Version:</b>    What version the data is from Ensembl, RefSeq or other</li>
<li><b>Scaffolds:</b>   This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series</li>
<li><b>Genes:</b>      Name of the gene/Number of genes in the genome</li>
<li><b>Segments:</b>   How many segments are there in the genome</li>
</ul>


<p>
The data on the website is completely accessible to the public, and you are free to download it all or simply choose particular genes. You must first find the table that contains the data you are looking for in order to do this. In general, you will first need to select some options in the boxes at the top of the page that has the necessary table. This refines your search to find what you are specifically looking for.  However, there are two choices available to you if you are on the website's Species page.The first box besides the header "Genome" on the table must be selected in order to select all of the data. Next, click the download button that will appear on the upper right corner of the table. Use the search bar to find the desired genes, then click the box to the left of each gene's name to only choose those genes.
</p>


<h4><p><u>Global Selection</h4></p></u>
One of the tools available on the website is Global Selection. This means that when a gene is selected anywhere on our website, either through a table, or graphically, it will continue to be added to your selection. This selection persists across pages and this may affect any plots, searches or data you wish to download.If you wish to avoid this,it is important to ensure that no genes are still selected in the table beforehand. You can do this by selecting then unselecting the box next to the first heading of a table, if you are on the Species section or by unselecting the options you have picked in the boxes at the top of the section you are on. Note that Global Selection is specific for genes selected, it does not persist with species selected.

<h4><p><u>Databases, Internal Links and External Links</u></p></h4>

On our website, the tables have a 'source' component that leads you to outside websites. Since the website only has a limited number of genes and genomes available, these external links take you to digital databases where you can explore more information. The information on the external databases might be used to help you learn more or conduct research on a topic of interest. Ensembl, RefSeq, and other external datasets are included.
