<li><h3>This is a general guide for the website</h3></li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Tables</h4></p></u>
<ul>
<li>The tables contain ohnolog datasets</li>
<li>All the data from the website is public</li>
<li>All the data available in the tables on the website are downloadable. You can either download all the data or select specific genes</li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Global Selection</h4></p></u>
<ul>
<li>When genes have been previously selected, even on another tab, they are still selected and this may affect any plots, searches or data you wish to download. To avoid this problem it is important to make sure that no genes are still selected in the table beforehand</li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Databases and External Links</u></p></h4>
<ul>
<li>In the tables there is a 'source' section, this leads to external links</li>
<li>These external links lead to digital databases as the website only has a small selection of the genes and genomes available</li>
<li>You can use the data on the external databases to further learn or research what you are interested in</li>
<li>The external databases are Ensembl,RefSeq and other</li>
</ul>

<h4><p><u>Internal Links</u></p></h4>
<ul>
<li>Selecting various genes and genomes allows you to construct circos plots and dotplots as well as view relevant sections on the gene tree 
</ul>
