<h4><p><u>Dotplots</u></p></h4>

<p>Dotplots can be used to compare the genomes of two different species. In essence, it has a vertical and horizontal axis with scattered data in the form of dots. It is a way to visualise the provided data and to recognise, simply, the similarities and differences between species.</p>

<h4><p><u>Constructing a Dotplot</h4></u></p>

<p>You can create your own dotplot on our website with ease to compare the genomes of two different species of choice. Choose the species you want to view on the dotplot from the drop-down menus in the 'Query species' and 'Subject species' boxes at the top of the 'Dotplot' section. The same species may be used twice, but in order for the dotplot to be created, you must select an option in both of the boxes. </p>
