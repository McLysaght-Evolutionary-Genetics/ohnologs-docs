### BLAST search

Our website provides a way to search out database by protein sequence similarity using BLAST. This can be useful if you have a specific gene of interest and a) it is not currently in our database, or b) you also want to analyse its homologs.

### BLAST input

The BLAST input should be provided in the text area in FASTA format; The header line should contain the '>' character immediately followed by the protein identifier. The protein sequence should start on a new line following the header and may be split into multiple lines.

:::note

We only support a single fasta entry at any one time.

:::

In order to begin the BLAST search, press the 'search' button below the text area. Alternatively, you can clear the text area by pressing the 'cancel' button. The search may take around 10 seconds - any results will be displayed in a table below the input fields.

##### Data table

The gene table displayed on this page follows our standard layout, you can read more about it here (link).

##### Data download

All gene data returned from the BLAST search can be downloaded by pressing the download button above the table. If you want to download a subset of the data, you can read more about selecting table entries here (link).

:::caution

Unlike other tables, this download only downloads the BLAST results

##### Linking

You can view more information about a gene by clicking on any of the entries listed under the 'source' table column.

You can also jump to the gene tree or synteny data visualisations containing a particular gene entry by clicking the appropriate buttons in the protein column. Read more about data linking (here).
