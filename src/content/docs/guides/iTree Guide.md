### <u>Gene Trees </u>

A gene tree is a visual representation showing genes and their evolutionary history. Gene trees are useful for analysing the evolution of specific genomes as well as reconstructing ancient genomes.

### <u> Constructing a Gene Tree </u>

A good feature of our website is that you can easily make gene trees to view the evolutionary history of a certain species or a protein. Two search boxes named  'Species' and 'Protein' are located near the top of the 'Tree' section. Type the species of choice in the "Species" box, and the name of the protein you are looking for in the "Protein" box. It should be noted that only one box could be filled out, not necessarily both. Once the box or boxes have been filled in click the blue 'Search' button located underneath the search boxes

This is the search box for proteins:

This is an example of a gene tree that was constructed when the protein 'ENSDARP00000137849' was searched:

### <u> Navigating the Gene Tree </u>

Once you have created your gene tree there are a few features you can use,

<ul>
<li>Any branch of the tree can be highlighted in red by clicking on it. Click it once more to cancel the highlighting.</li>
<li>By clicking and dragging the screen (on a section other than a branch), you can highlight several tree segments in blue, dotted lines. Then, by dragging this box around the screen, other tree branches can be highlighted. The blue highlighting is removed by right clicking and then left clicking.</li>
</ul>

This is an example of the features you can use when navigating the tree:
