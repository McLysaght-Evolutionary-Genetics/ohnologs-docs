<h4><p><u>Search Boxes</h4></p></u>

<p>A convenient feature of our website are the search boxes, they a useful tool for focusing your search for the genomes of a particular species you are looking for. These search search boxes are listed in the table below. The table below lists the titles of the search boxes</p>

| Source | State |

<ul>
<li><b>Source:</b> Where the data in the table came from</li>
<li><b>State:</b>
</ul>


<p>The 'Exact' function, that can be found next to the search boxes, is beneficial if you are trying to find a very particular genome. When selected, the table will show results with the specific label you seleted in the drop box. When it is not selected the table will show all the results that have relevant labels.</p>

<h4><p><u>Using the Table</u></p></h4>

<p>In this part of the website you have the ability to search for a specific genome. The table below lists each of the headings on the table</p>


| Genome | Species | State | Source | Version | Scaffolds | Segments | Genes |

<ul>
<li><b>Genome:</b> The name of the genome
<li><b>Species:</b> The name of the species
<li><b>State:</b> The genomes will either be present, a modern genome, or , an ancestral genome
<li><b>Source:</b> Where the data in the table came from
<li><b>Version:</b> What version the data is from Ensembl, RefSeq or other
<li><b>Scaffolds:</b> This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series
<li><b>Segments:</b>  How many segments are there in the genome
<li><b>Genes:</b> The name of the gene
</ul>
