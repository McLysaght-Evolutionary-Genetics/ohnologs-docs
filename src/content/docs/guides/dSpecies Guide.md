### <u>Search Boxes </u>

A convenient feature of our website are the search boxes, they a useful tool for focusing your search for the genomes of a particular species you are looking for. These search search boxes are listed in the table below. The table below lists the titles of the search boxes

| Source | State |

<ul>
<li><b>Source:</b> Where the data in the table came from</li>
<li><b>State:</b> The genome will either be present, a modern genome, or other, an ancient genome
</ul>


### <u>Using the Table </u>

In this part of the website you have the ability to search for a specific genome. The table below lists each of the headings on the table


| Genome | Species | State | Source | Version | Scaffolds | Segments | Genes |

<ul>
<li><b>Genome:</b> The name of the genome
<li><b>Species:</b> The name of the species
<li><b>State:</b> The genomes will either be present, a modern genome, or , an ancestral genome
<li><b>Source:</b> Where the data in the table came from
<li><b>Version:</b> What version the data is from Ensembl, RefSeq or other
<li><b>Scaffolds:</b> This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series
<li><b>Segments:</b>  How many segments are there in the genome
<li><b>Genes:</b> The name of the gene
</ul>

You are able to download any of the data as you wish. Use the search boxes, mentioned previously, to find the specific data you are looking for. Once the table updates there will be a blue 'Download' button located to the top right of the table. If you have previosuly made any selections they will persist across both pages and become selected in the tables. If you wish to avoid this click the 'Cancel' button found on the top right of the table.
