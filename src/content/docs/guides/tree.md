### Introduction

Our website provides dynamically-generated gene trees. Gene trees are useful for visualising the evolutionary history of a gene and all of its homologs. Given that whole genome duplications create additional copies of every gene in the genome, we expect to see bifurcations in any given WGD tree where genes on either side of this node are ohnologous.

### Tree settings

In order to display a gene tree, you must first select which tree/orthogroup you wish to plot. This can be done by entering a gene or protein identifier into the provided textbox and pressing the 'search' button. This will match the identifier against our database and attempt to find the gene tree that it belongs to.

Selecting the query tree/orthogroup will generate a gene tree and display a table containing every gene present in the tree.

### Reading the tree

The tree shows the evolutionary history of all genes in the selected orthogroup. Each tree is rooted on amphioxus genes as an outgroup. Each bifurcating node represents a gene duplication event. Whole genome duplication nodes are highlighten in red. Leaf nodes are labelled with the gene species and protein identifier.

:::note

Branch lengths represent evolutionary time.

##### Data table

All genes belonging to the query tree/orthogroup will be shown in a table below the tree. The table displayed on this page follows our standard layout, you can read more about it here (link).

##### Data download

All genes present in the current tree can be downloaded by pressing the download button above the table. If you want to download a subset of the data, you can read more about selecting table entries here (link).

:::caution

Unlike other tables, this download only tree data

##### Linking

You can view more information about a gene by clicking on any of the entries listed under the 'source' table column.

You can also jump to the gene tree or synteny data visualisations containing a particular gene entry by clicking the appropriate buttons in the protein column. Read more about data linking (here).
