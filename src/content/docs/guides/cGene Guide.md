### <u>Dropdown Menus </u>

A useful feature of this section of our website is that you can easily narrow down your search for specific ohnologs by checking boxes which saves you a lot of time manually navigating through pages of tables. Here you can choose the species, source, labels, chromosome and segment you need.

The 'strict match' box that is seen under 'Labels' is a convenient way to further refine your search. Once selected the table will only show results with the specific label that you previously selected rather than all relevant genes with similar labels. If unselected the table will show you all the ohnologs with relevant labels.

 The table below lists the headings of the dropdown menus you will see in the 'Gene' section. 


| Species | Source | Labels | Chromosome | Segment |

<ul>
<li><b>Species:</b> Select the species of interest from the drop box</li>
<li><b>Source:</b> Select which source you want the data from. It will either be Ensembl or other</li>
<li><b>Labels:</b> Evidence-based. They will either be micro-synteny, macro-synteny or gene phylogeny</li>
<li><b>Chromosome:</b> What chromsome the gene is located one </li>
<li><b>Segment:</b> How many segments are there in the genome </li>
</ul>

### <u> Using the Table </u>

You can use the table in this section of the website to find certain genes of interest. Once you have refined your search using the dropdown menus, explained in the paragraph above, a table will then automatically update to show the relevant genes. 

These are dropdown menus you can use to narrow down the search for your ohnolog of interest:

This is an example of a table generated using chicken (species), 1 (chromosome) and ensembl (source) as the input, take note of the download button (rhs):

<u>Below is a table listing all the headings in the table,</u>

| Gene | Protein | Species | Source | Scaffold | Segment | Labels |

<ul>
<li><b>Gene:</b> Name of the gene</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b> Name of the protein. Note that two blue icons can be found there; these are internal links that will direct you to a location on our website. Once you have chosen your genes, these direct you to certain areas of the website. You can access the Tree sectionÂ part by clicking the icon to the left, and the Synteny section by clicking the icon to the right.</li>
<li><b>Species:</b> Name of the species</li>
<li><b>Source:</b>  Where the data came from</li>
<li><b>Scaffold:</b> This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series</li>
<li><b>Segment: </b> How many segments are there in the genome</li>
<li><b>Labels:</b> Evidence-based. They will either be micro-synteny, macro-synteny or gene phylogeny</li>
</ul>

You can download any of the data found on the website. To do this go to the section of the website that has the data you would be looking for, genes/genomes/proteins, and use the selction boxes to refine your search. Once the table has been updated there will be a 'Download' button on the right hand side of the table. Note that if you have previosuly made any selections they will persist across both pages and become selected in the tables. If you wish to avoid this click the 'Cancel' button found on the top right of the table.

Look for this button on the tables if you wish to download any data from our site:

### <u> Ensembl and Internal Links </u>
There are external links within our website that can help you to find more in-depth information regarding the genes that you are interested in. These links can be found under the 'Source' heading of the tables, towards the bottom of the pages, lead to external databases such as Ensembl which is a genome database.

In addition to this, there are two internal links in the table under the 'Protein' heading. These links will lead you to the 'Phylogeny' and 'Synteny' pages within our website. The blue icon on the left will lead you to the phylogeny page and the blue icon on the right will lead you to the synteny page. If you have previosuly made any selections they will persist across both pages and become selected in the tables which means you do not have to manually make the same selections again. However, if this is something that you wish to avoid this click the 'Cancel' button found on the top right of the table.
