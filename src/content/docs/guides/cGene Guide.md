<h4><p><u>Search Boxes</h4></p></u>

<p>A useful feature of this section of our website is that you can easily narrow down your search for specific genes by checking boxes which saves you from having to manually navigate through pages of tables. The table below lists all the boxes you will see in the 'Gene' section.
</p>

| Species | Source | Labels |

<ul>
<li><b>Species:</b> Select the species of interest from the drop box</li>
<li><b>Source:</b> Select which source you want the data from. It will either be Ensembl or other</li>
<li><b>Labels:</b>            </li>
</ul>

<p>An important feature of this table is the 'Exact' box which can be found under the boxes mentioned above. When you choose 'Exact,' you choose only the genes with that specific label. You will receive all the genes with all related labels if 'Exact' is not selected.</p>

<h4><p><u>Using the Table</h4></p></u>

<p>You can use the table in this section of the website to find certain genes of interest. Below is a table listing all the headings in the table</p>

| Gene | Protein | Species | Source | Scaffold | Segment | Labels |


<ul>
<li><b>Gene:</b> Name of the gene</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b> Name of the protein. Note that two blue icons can be found there; these are internal links that will direct you to a location on our website. Once you have chosen your genes, these direct you to certain areas of the website. You can access the Tree section part by clicking the icon to the left, and the Synteny section by clicking the icon to the right.</li>
<li><b>Species:</b> Name of the species</li>
<li><b>Source:</b>  Where the data came from</li>
<li><b>Scaffold:</b> This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series</li>
<li><b>Segment: </b> How many segments are there in the genome</li>
<li><b>Labels:</b></li>


<h4><p><u>Ensembl</h4></p></u>

<p>Ensembl is a browser for genome sequences, this was included as not all genomes are available on the website. There are external links on our website under the 'Source' heading of many tables, some of them lead to this browser and from there you can search for other genome sequences.</p>
