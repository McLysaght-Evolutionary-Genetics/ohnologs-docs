### <u> Circos Plots </u>

Circos plots are circular visual displays used for showing genomic data. They make it easy to visualise certain genomic patterns. In our case it shows gene paralogy relationships.The arcs which compose the circle are chromosomes and are labelled as such. All the lines on the inside of the circle going from chromosome to chromosome are homologous genes. Blocks are charecteristic of whole genome duplications and you may see this on your plot, they will appear as many genes in the same location on the plot.


### <u> Creating a Circos Plot</u>

As mentioned previously, circos plots are very useful for displaying all kinds of genomic data in a simplistic way that makes it easy to understand. In order to make a circos plot on our website you will need to select the species of choice in the search boxes called 'Query species' and click enter. Note that only one species can be selected for the circos plot at a time and that once a circos plot has been created, the gene table will be at the very bottom of the page and the plot will change based on selection. 

Refreshing the page or going to another section of the website and coming back will both remove the circos plot you made.

### <u> Using the Table </u>

Once you have created you circos plot the table will list all the genes and proteins it has for the query species you selected previously. With this you can download any data that is relevant to you by selecting it from the table and using the blue 'Download' button found at the top right of the table.

If you are looking for further information relating to a particular gene, there are external links under the 'Source' heading on the table which leads to Ensembl. Similar to that, there are two internal links under the 'Protein' heading on the table. The blue icon to the left will take you to the tree section of the website and the blue icon to the right will take you to the synteny section of the website.  From there, the selection you made will persist across both pages and become selected in the tables. If you wish, you have the ability to download the data you are interested in.
