<p>Circos plots are circular visual displays used for showing genomic data. They are quite helpful in displaying large amounts of data in a manner that is simple to understand. The main outer circle acts as a point of origin for interpreting the relationships and patterns displayed within the plot, whilst the patterns inside the circle depict the relationship between the data, for instance it could be displaying various connections between genes.</p>

<h4><p><u>Creating a Circos Plot</u></p></h4>

<p>As mentioned previously, circos plots are very useful for displaying all kinds of genomic data in a simplistic way that makes it easy to understand. In order to make a circos plot on our website you will need to select the species of choice in the search boxes called 'Query species' and click enter. Note that only one species can be selected for the circos plot at a time and that once a circos plot has been created, the table will be at the very bottom of the page.</p>
