### Introduction

Our website provides an interface for easily viewing and filtering all the speciess in our database.

##### Filtering

Our filtering feature allows users to narrow down the dataset to their liking without needing to download it first. Species data can be filtered by multiple attributes:

- source: the genome database from which a genome was sourced
- state: whether a genome is present-day or ancestral reconstruction

(include image?)

##### Data table

The table on this page displays all the species present in our database that match your selected filters.

The table on this page contains the following information:

- **Species:** The species name
- **State:** If the genome is present-day or an ancestral reconstruction
- **Source:** The database from which the genome was sourced
- **Version:** The version of the genome (corresponds to external database version)
- **Completeness:** If the assembly is chromosome or scaffold level
- **Chromosomes:** Number of chromosomes (or scaffolds in the case of a scaffold-level assembly) in the genome
- **Segments:** The number of macro-synteny segments in the genome (see link)
- **Genes:** The number of genes in the genome

##### Data download

All gene data can be downloaded by pressing the download button above the table. If you want to download a subset of the data, you can read more about selecting table entries here (link).

NOTE: document the download format

##### Linking

You can view more information about a species by clicking on any of the entries listed under the 'source' table column.
