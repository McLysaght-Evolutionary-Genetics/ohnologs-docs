 ### <u>What is BLAST?</u>

BLAST stands for Basic Local Asignment Search Tool and it is used for comparing genomic sequence. On our website the genes that are seen are ohnologs, genes that have arisen from a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) event.

### <u> Using the Table </u>

In this part of the website you have the ability to search for a specific gene sequence. To do this you type in the gene sequence you are looking for into the box above the 'Search' and 'Clear' buttons. Once you have typed in the gene sequence click the blue 'Search' button. If you wish to search for another gene sequence, or if you have made a mistake, click the grey 'Clear' button and type another sequence in. Note that search queries need to be in fasta format.

The table's headings are listed as follows:

| Gene | Protein | Species | Source | Scaffold | Segment | Labels |

The points below explain what each header in the table refers to, 


<ul>
<li><b>Gene:</b> Name of the gene</li>
<li><b>Protein:</b> Name of the protein</li>
<li><b>Species:</b>Name of the species</li>
<li><b>Source:</b> Where the data in the table came from. The possible sources are Ensembl, RefSeq or other</li>
<li><b>Scaffold:</b> This is the joining of a genomic sequence's non-contiguous series</li>
<li><b>Segment:</b> How many segments are there in the genome</li>
<li><b>Labels:</b></li>
</ul>
<br>

The information on our website is freely available to the public, and you are free to download it all or only pick and choose those genes you want to learn more about. You must first use the search box above the table to look for a gene sequence. You can then click the blue 'Download' box on the right side of the table.
